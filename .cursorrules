# Sanity Starter Project Rules

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- React 19 (Server Components by default)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Sanity CMS
- Tailwind CSS
- Biome for linting/formatting

## Code Style

### Formatting
- Use tabs for indentation (not spaces)
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use semicolons
- Maximum line length: reasonable (no hard limit, but keep readable)
- Trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays

### TypeScript
- Always use strict TypeScript
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use type imports: `import type { ... }`
- Use path aliases: `@/` for `src/`
- Export types from dedicated type files

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase, default exports
- Functions: camelCase
- Files: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE or camelCase depending on context

## Project Structure

### Components
- Organize by purpose: `layout/`, `sections/`, `utility/`
- Use default exports for React components
- Components should be in PascalCase files
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

### Sanity Schema
- Use constructor functions for reusable definitions: `defineLink`, `defineSection`, `defineImage`
- Schema files in `schema/` organized by type:
  - `documents/` - document types
  - `objects/` - object types
  - `constructors/` - reusable schema constructors
- Use `defineField` for inline field definitions
- Use `defineType` for registered schema types
- Include preview configurations for better Studio UX

### Types
- Centralize types in `types/` directory
- Export types from `types/index.ts` or dedicated files
- Use descriptive type names

### Utilities
- Place utility functions in `lib/`
- Add JSDoc comments to utility functions (no examples)
- Keep utilities pure and testable

## Code Patterns

### React Components
- Use Server Components by default
- Add `'use client'` directive only when needed
- Prefer function components
- Use TypeScript for props with explicit types
- Destructure props at the top of the component

### Sanity Schema
- Use conditional field visibility: `hidden: ({ parent }) => condition`
- Include descriptions for all fields
- Use validation rules where appropriate
- Add icons to schema types using lucide-react
- Preview configs should be informative and concise

### JSDoc Comments
- Add JSDoc to all exported functions
- Include parameter descriptions with `@param`
- Include return type with `@returns`
- Do NOT include `@example` sections
- Keep descriptions clear and concise

### Imports
- Group imports: external packages, then internal with `@/` aliases
- Use type imports for types: `import type { ... }`
- Sort imports logically (React, Next.js, Sanity, then project files)

### Error Handling
- Use try-catch for async operations
- Log errors with `console.error`
- Provide fallback values where appropriate

## Sanity-Specific Patterns

### Custom Input Components
- Place in `sanity/components/`
- Use Sanity UI components from `@sanity/ui`
- Access sibling fields using `useFormValue` with parent path
- Handle loading and error states
- Clear dependent fields when parent changes

### Schema Constructors
- Return field definitions using `defineField` for inline use
- Return type definitions using `defineType` for registered types
- Accept configuration options with sensible defaults
- Include JSDoc documentation

### Queries
- Organize queries in `sanity/lib/queries/`
- Use fragments for reusable query parts
- Keep queries focused and efficient

## Next.js Patterns

### App Router
- Use route groups: `(site)`, `(studio)`
- Server Components by default
- API routes in `app/api/`
- Metadata generation functions

### Data Fetching
- Use Sanity client for data fetching
- Implement draft mode for preview
- Use proper caching strategies

## Best Practices

### General
- Write self-documenting code (prefer clear code over comments)
- Remove unnecessary comments
- Keep functions small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into utilities
- Use meaningful variable names
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals

### Performance
- Use React hooks appropriately (useMemo, useCallback when needed)
- Optimize Sanity image queries
- Implement proper loading states
- Use Next.js Image component for images

### Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen readers

## What NOT to Do

- Don't use `any` type without good reason
- Don't create unnecessary wrapper components
- Don't mix client and server component patterns unnecessarily
- Don't hardcode values that should be configurable
- Don't skip error handling
- Don't use `console.log` in production code (use `console.error` for errors)
- Don't include example code in JSDoc comments

## File Naming

- Components: `ComponentName.tsx`
- Utilities: `utilityName.ts`
- Types: `types.ts` or `typeName.ts`
- Schema: `schemaName.ts`
- Constructors: `defineName.ts`

## When Creating New Code

1. Check if similar patterns exist in the codebase
2. Follow existing file organization
3. Add JSDoc to exported functions
4. Use TypeScript strictly
5. Test the code works as expected
6. Ensure it follows Biome formatting rules
